To reproduce the results: open the genai_experiment.R script in R (at least 4.3.3; RStudio IDE recommended) and follow the instructions there. Place all data files and the functions script file in a folder and define the path in the genai_experiment script. Required packages also listed therein; source/run the requirements.R script to install all required packages, or run selectively to install just the minimal e.g. for partial replication (the full install includes reticulate and Python). If not using the precomputed data (where image cosine similarities have been computed), then download the full set of images from Zenodo doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14710706 , unzip and place the data folders in the project folder created above.
